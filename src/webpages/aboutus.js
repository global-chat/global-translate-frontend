          <p>Charles Clemens</p>
          <p>Charles is my name and I am many things beside a full stack web developer (though I do find myself humming Kip's ode to technology from the movie Napolean Dynamite quite often).

          Family man, martial artist, veteran, author, comedian, gamer, bassist, public speaker; these are all labels that describe different aspects of myself. At the core I am a man that yearns for growth, a lifelong learner that spends more time researching, contemplating, and practicing than watching tv.

          I believe in the chase and motivating others to chase after their own dreams makes me smile.

          All too often the inner critic receives more attention than it deserves so everyone wins when we can keep it silent. The inner critic is a liar that does not want you to know the truth: that we can convert dreams, no matter how big, into circumstances as long as we are willing to put in the work to make that happen.</p>
