## Overview

We created this application so people can communicate with each other requardless of one's language barrier. The Application is a chatroom that people can join and select their language preference and start chatting with another person. Everybody that joined the chat will have a different screen depending on the language they selected. For Example, if I selected Chinese and join the chat room and my friend selected German his screen will be in German and my screen will be in Chinese.
